# Covid-Statistics

This is an ongoing project.

Final project for a class. The project had to use data from the NYTimes Github. The project was to create multiple functions that could manipulate the data. This includes getting dates of first cases, number of days between first case to the first death, number of new cases between dates, total events for the state, number of events per capita, state with the maximum days between first case and first death, state with the minimum days between first case and first death, events on a particular date, total number of US events, state with most events per capita, state with fewest events per capita, and the date of the first event for the specified state.

New functions were later added including those that will write to a file and a function that gets the number of new cases in between the states opening dates and the latest compiled date. State's policies will affect the statistics and it will be good to see how numbers fluctuate with different opening dates.
