# Covid-Statistics
This started as a final project for a class. However this project is ongoing as long as it is needed to keep track of the COVID 19 crisis. For this project the only premade functions allowed to use were:  split(), strip(), date(), open(), close(), max(), min(). A second project is in progress that will produce same results but minimalist in nature.

The goal of this project is to get relevant information of cases and/or deaths in individual states within the US. This program includes: dates of first cases, number of days between first case to the first death, number of new cases between dates, total events for the state, number of events per capita, states with the maximum days between first case and first death, states with the minimum days between first case and first death, events on a particular date, total number of US events, states with most events per capita, states with fewest events per capita, and the date of the first event for the specified state. 

When the program is run as is, it creates a file with only some statistics. New functions will be added that will help track changes in cases and deaths. This is in order to see if a specific states policy affects their numbers of cases and deaths.


*The project had to use data provided by the [NYTimes](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data).
