# Covid-Statistics

This is an ongoing project.

Final project for a class. Only functions allowed: split(), strip(), date(), open(), close(), max(), min(). The project had to use data provided by the [NYTimes](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data). The goal of this project is to get relevant information of cases and/or deaths in the individual states. This program includes dates of first cases, number of days between first case to the first death, number of new cases between dates, total events for the state, number of events per capita, state with the maximum days between first case and first death, state with the minimum days between first case and first death, events on a particular date, total number of US events, state with most events per capita, state with fewest events per capita, and the date of the first event for the specified state. When the program is run as is, it creates a file with only some functions. 

New functions will be added that will help track changes in cases/deaths in order to see if states policies affect their cases/death numbers.
